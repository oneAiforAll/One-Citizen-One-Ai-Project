> **Making AI accessible to everyone, regardless of income, status, or disability.**

---

## 🌟 Vision

One-Citizen-One-Ai-Project is building an open **AI Community Center** model that any city, region, or organization can adopt. We believe AI should be a public good—not a luxury.

Our mission is to give every citizen:
- 🤖 Access to a reliable personal AI assistant
- 🛠️ Practical tools for daily life, work, and wellbeing
- 📚 Simple, accessible AI education (no technical background required)
- 🤝 A cooperative, transparent community that co-creates ethical AI

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

AI is transforming the world, but it's not reaching everyone equally. We're changing that by:

✅ **Supporting those who need it most**: People with disabilities, caregivers, small businesses, creators, and local communities

✅ **Building cooperative infrastructure**: Community-owned AI resources instead of corporate monopolies

✅ **Making AI practical**: Real tools for real problems—scheduling, communication, accessibility, learning, health support

✅ **Keeping it ethical**: Transparent governance, privacy-first design, human-centered values

---

## 🚀 Core Goals

1. **Universal Access**: Every citizen gets a personal AI assistant and curated tools
2. **Education for All**: Make AI literacy simple and accessible for non-technical people
3. **Cooperative Governance**: Communities decide how AI is deployed locally
4. **Pilot Projects**: Connect sponsors, institutions, and communities around concrete initiatives
